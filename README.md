# Task 8 - House Price Prediction with Feature Engineering

## Objective:
To improve the accuracy of house price predictions by applying effective feature engineering on the Kaggle House Prices dataset.

## Dataset:
- train.csv from Kaggle's Advanced Regression Techniques competition

## Key Steps:
1. Handled missing values (mode/median)
2. Applied Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding
3. Used log transformation to reduce skewness
4. Trained a Random Forest model
5. Evaluated using RMSE
6. Visualized feature importances

## Result:
Achieved a strong baseline RMSE using Random Forest and feature engineering.
